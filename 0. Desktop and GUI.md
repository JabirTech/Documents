# Desktop and GUI Installation Guide

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to install X, a simple desktop (Like XFCE) and some of necessary software on your JabirOS based computer.t'
## Preparing Operating System

First, you need to update ```pkg``` list. You just need to type:

```
	pkg update
```

__ATTENTION__ : If it's the first time you use pkg, it will be installed on your system and then, starts command you entered. 

## Installing and Configuring X and Desktop

In this tutorial, we're going to install [XFCE](http://xfce.org) on our JabirOS computer, but you can use [GNOME](http://gnome.org) , [KDE](http://kde.org) or 
whatever you want.

### Installing X.org

If you want to have a desktop system, you need to install a display server, first. [X](http://x.org) is the best choice if you're on __JabirOS__ . Linux and BSD 
distributions usually use X, but there're some exceptions, for example some of [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) users prefer _Wayland_. But, we still work with
the lovely X. 

To install X, just type this command in the shell :

```
	pkg install xorg
```

It may take several minutes to install.

### Installing Desktop

Now, it's ready for installing a desktop environment. for _XFCE_, just type :

```
	pkg install xfce4
```

For desktop, you need a login manager. We use __SLiM__ in this tutorial, because it's simple and compatible with XFCE. 

```
	pkg install slim
```

Now, we have to configure our system.

### Configuration 

The ```vi``` editor is installed by default. You need to edit ```/etc/rc.conf``` by using this editor, or if you aren't familiar with it, you can use
__GNU nano__ as a good replacement. You need to add these lines to your config file:

```
	dbus_enable = "YES"
	hald_enable = "YES"
	moused_enable = "YES"
	slim_enable = "YES"
```

and now, by typing ```reboot``` , and after system boots, you'll get SLiM. 

### Necessary Software

It depends on you, but usually desktop users need :
1. Web Browser
2. Music Player
3. Text Editor
4. Image Viewer
5. Image Editor
6. Office Suite
7. Jabber client

For these seven items, we suggest __Firefox, VLC, Mousepad, Shotwell, GIMP, LibreOffice (or OpenOffice) and Pidgin__ . You can install them by ```pkg```.
